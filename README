CinemaController
================

* License is LGPL v2.1+ unless otherwise specified.

* Compile each subdirectory individually - they are currently separate qmake projects

* Depends on Qt 5

* launch.sh and shutdown.sh need to both be manually installed to the bindir for the system to work

* For help, go to #icucinema on freenode.

* More information on how we got it all set up and running is here:
